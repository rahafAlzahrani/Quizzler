# Quizzler‚ùì

Simple true/false quiz mobile app, Build using Dart programming language and Flutter toolkit in Android Studio.

## Splash Screen
The splash screen in this app loads for 4 seconds, and while it is loading, there is a sound effect played. for achieving that, I used the (audioplayers) package, it is an awesome package so check it out.

#### for installation 
```bash
audioplayers: ^0.16.1
```

and for the alert popup that notifies the user that he reaches the end of the quiz, I used (rflutter_alert) package, it is an awesome package too. 

#### for installation 
```bash
rflutter_alert: ^1.1.0
```
